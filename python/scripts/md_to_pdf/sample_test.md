## Extended Syntax

Additionally **MD2FILE** supports various Markdown flavors, including **CommonMark**, **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**, and **Markdown Extra**. This includes advanced features such as tables, task lists, footnotes, definition lists, and fenced code blocks, making it ideal for complex document formatting.

## Markdown extensions

**MD2FILE** enhances Markdown with additional extensions, bringing powerful features to your documents.

### LaTeX

Render complex mathematical expressions with [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).

For example, the _Beta function_ is defined as:

$$
B(x, y) = \int_0^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1} dt
$$

### Diagramms and charts

Use [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) to render diagrams such as this sequence chart:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
User->>System: Login request
System-->>Database: Validate credentials
Database--x System: Invalid user
System-->>User: Access denied
```

Or this flowchart:

```mermaid
graph LR
Start --> Step1[Process Data]
Step1 --> Decision{Condition Met?}
Decision -->|Yes| Step2[Generate Report]
Decision -->|No| End
Step2 --> End
```

### Code Syntax Highlighting
